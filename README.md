# PIC assembly programing

My final project for a PIC assembly class I took in Junior year of high school. It's a simple four button calculator written in pure assembly. It's operation is described in the PDF

Also included is also a PIC debugger I wrote for myself in python3 as I couldn't MPLab to work in my computer. It also came in handy when writing [LadderiLogical](https://github.com/mikadam/LadderiLogical)
